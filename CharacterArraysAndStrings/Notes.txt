1. It is recommended that character arrays should be null terminated.
2. Simply declaring an array and doing cin>> would not work if there is a space between that Strings that are inputted.
3. Doing strlen(arr) and sizeof(arr) would give different results. Sizeof would count 1 more than Strlen since sizeof would also count null character.
