ARRAYS
    1. int arr[100] = {0} => Initialisation List, 100 memory blocks all initialised with 0.
    2. int arr[100] = {1,2,3} => Initialisation List, {1,2,3,0,0......,0}.
    3. Size of various data types
        1. Integer => 4 bytes
        2. Char => 1 byte
        3. Float => 4 bytes
        4. Double => 8 bytes
        5. Pointer variable => 8 bytes
    4. Time complexity of linear search is O(N).
    5. Reverse array time complexity O(N).
    6. Printing pairs Time Complexity O(N^2).
    7. Kadane time complexity O(N) and space complexity is O(1).

VECTORS
    1. Vectors can be used to create dynamic 1D and 2D arrays.
    2. Unlike arrays vectors are passed by value to the functions but they can also be passed by reference.
