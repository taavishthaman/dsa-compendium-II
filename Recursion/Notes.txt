1. Factorial 
    Time Complexity => O(N)
    Space Complexity => O(N)
2. Fibonacci 
    Time Complexity => O(2^N)
    Space Complexity => O(N) => Max Depth of recursion tree
3. Tiling Problem 
    Let's consider a case where the board is of length 4 X N and tiles have dimensions of 1 X N. Probably a good idea to always use this case.

    Recursive case would be => f(res) = f(N - 1) + f(N - 4)
    For the base case
        1. If N is 0 => 1 way
        2. If N is 1 => 1 way
        3. If N is 2 => 1 way
        4. If N is 3 => 1 way

    So we can say if N <= M - 1 then return 1 and that would be the base case
